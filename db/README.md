### Database

The database schema and views are defined in this folder.

There is also a docker-compose file which executes a simple docker container so that you do not need to install docker yourself.

You can run this container in the background using `docker-compose up -d` from inside this folder.

The `-d` will run postgres in the background and you can access logs using `docker-compose logs` inside this folder as well.

To kill the docker instance use `docker-compose down`.

This docker-compose is just so that you don't need to configure postgres on your local machine during development.
